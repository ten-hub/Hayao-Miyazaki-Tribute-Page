## Project Description
<br/>


This is the first tribute page that I made and I decided to contribute it to my most loved animator Hayao Miyazaki, the Ghibli legend. I spent quite some time to researching all the content on the page but I missed out on all the references. 

The tribute page is built with HTML, a little bit of CSS styling and is deployed via Netlify. 

Feel free to visit the page [here](hayao-miyazaki-ten-hub.netlify.app) or just go on the link down below.

## Retrospect & Future Plans
<br/>


Building a pure HTML page like this really consolidate the HTML basics. Plus, reasearching things you love is just a enjoyable process in general. Definitely would recommend it to anyone who is trying to consolidate their HTML basics as well. 

Future plan:
* Build test for the page.
