        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Hayao Miyazaki's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1941</strong> - Born in Bunkyō ward of Tokyo, Japan.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1963</strong> - Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin University with degrees in political science and economics. MIyazaki took a position as an entry-level animator at Tōei Animation, a division of the Tōei studio and Asia’s largest producer of animation. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1968</strong> - Married a fellow animator, Akemi Ota. MIyazaki's first motion picture in which he played a major role was released: Prince of the Sun, a collaboration with the chief animator Yasuo Otsuka and the director Isao Takahata.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1971</strong> - Miyazaki left Tōei Animation and joined Takahata at A Pro, where he became involved in a failed effort to make an animated feature of Pippi Longstockings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1973</strong> - Miyazaki moved to Zuiyo Pictures, where he designed the scenes for Heidi: Girl of the Alps. Zuiyō Eizō continued as Nippon Animation in July 1975.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1979</strong> - Left Nippon Animation and joined Telecom, a subsidiary of TMS Entertainment, to direct his first feature anime film, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), a Lupin III film.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1982</strong> - Miyazaki resigned from Telecom and began one of his most popular manga series. It is based on the character Nausicaä, a princess living in a future where humanity is in peril of extinction. Tokuma production company asked Miyazaki, who was by then an instructor for beginning animators and a very experienced director of television cartoons, to make the Nausicaä stories into an animated feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> -  Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was released on March 11.  It grossed ¥1.48 billion at the box office, and made an additional ¥742 million in distribution income.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1985</strong> - The success of "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind" encouraged Miyazaki and Takahata to undertake a more permanent partnership arrangement. Miyazaki, Takahata, Tokuma and Suzuki founded the animation production company Studio Ghibli, with funding from Tokuma Shoten. Miyazaki pronounced Ghibli as "jee-blee," after the Italian word for a dry Saharan wind as well as the name for a World War I aircraft. The idea being the studio would "blow a new wind through the anime industry".
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>1986</strong> - Studio Ghibli's first film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky was released. It won the Animage Anime Grand Prix and grossed over $16 million at the box office.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> - Disney Becomes The Sole Distributor To Studio Ghibli. Studio Ghibli's parent company, Tokuma, hit hard times. Fortunately the big box-office success in Japan of Kiki's Delivery Service had attracted the attention of Disney; Disney offered a deal that would relieve Tokuma of its financial burdens in exchange for the distribution rights worldwide—save in Southeast Asia—for motion pictures produced by Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki's approved explaining that he already had more money than he could possibly spend in one lifetime and that Tokuma had helped him out when he had needed it. The deal was formalized in 1996 and underwent revisions thereafter, such as the later addition of DVD distribution rights for Disney.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1997</strong> - Princess Mononoke, Studio Ghibli’s first PG-13 rated film was released on July 12. It became the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year. The film earned a domestic total of ¥14 billion (US$148 million) and becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan for several months. Mononoke proved to be one of Ghibli's most expensive productions to date, and the stress of that work prompted Miyazaki to push for an early retirement.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1998</strong> - Miyazaki had announced that Princess Mononoke would be his final film and he would be leaving Studio Ghibli. His eyesight was failing, and he believed that he could not guarantee as high a quality of art in his motion pictures as he wished. but he return to work shortly after in the January of 1999.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999</strong> - Princess Mononoke was later released in the US by Disney, but under its Miramax label run by Harvey Weinstein due to the film theme not matching with Disney's brand. The former Hollywood executive was known as “Harvey Scissorhands” in the industry and wanted to mess around with the film to cater to a Western audience. As confirmed by Hayao Miyazaki himself, Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki sent Weinstein a samurai sword with a note that simply said “no cuts.” The message was received and an uncut Princess Mononoke was released in theaters, but to a limited domestic audience.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> - The film 'Spirited Away' was released, grossing $395.8 million at the worldwide box office. it became the most successful and highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ¥31.68 billion ($305 million).
          </li>
          <li><strong>2013</strong> - Miyazaki announced that he was retiring from the production of feature films due to his age, but wished to continue working on the displays at the Studio Ghibli Museum.</li>
          <li><strong>2016</strong> - Miyazaki proposed a new feature-length film, How Do You Live?, on which he began animation work without receiving official approval.</li>

            "Many of my movies have strong female leads- brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe with all their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man."
